## Part I - Foundations

*This course is not created by me. It is just for demo purpose. [(__original link__)](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/)*

The way we access the internet has changed. With the growth of smartphones and mobile devices, we are seeing millions of people from around the world using the internet for the first time on a mobile device. Google is supporting Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to help developers provide native-app qualities in web applications that are reliable, fast, and engaging.

This course is aimed at:

Beginning-to-intermediate web developers.
Web developers who are comfortable using HTML, CSS, and have modest facility with JavaScript.
Developers who want to build web experiences that work for everyone.
This course shows you how to convert web pages to PWAs. A PWA is not an API or a technology, but it is a web development approach that uses a combination of tools and technologies already available to create targeted, ideal user experiences. It shows how to use service workers, APIs, and an application shell architecture for meaningful offline experiences, fast first load, and easy user reengagement upon repeat visits.
